                    I’m an engineer and researcher excited about solving complex problems in vision, language, and robotics. Currently, I’m a sophomore at UC Berkeley studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS).

                    At Berkeley, I conduct robotics-AI research at <a href=https://autolab.berkeley.edu>AUTOLab</a>, focusing on autonomous suturing. I’m also deeply involved in <a href=https://ml.studentorg.berkeley.edu/>Machine Learning @ Berkeley</a>, where I've taught ML lectures and developed content for our new member and high school outreach programs.

                    I also spent my last summer interning at <a href=https://matterport.com>Matterport</a>, working on an internal semantic search tool.

                    Beyond academics, I enjoy curating Spotify playlists, sketching my friends, occasionally reading, and taking care of my ever-growing collection of houseplants. If any of this resonates with you, feel free to reach out!
